## dylanhulbert.github.io/homework-02
I created the contents of this repo as homework for my Bootcamp at UofO
## Changes
Had to start over to leverage flexbox
### Homework 02: Responsive Portfolio
* Used flexbox grid
* Updated the navbar and added sticky footer
* A responsive layout
* Responsive images
* Multiple pages
* Additional Stylesheet
### Additional notes/lessons learned
I got a little copy/paste crazy, and needed to start over to keep things clean.  Using Inspect in Google Devtools helped, but I clearly have more work to do.
